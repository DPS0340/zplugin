# null

**Note: zinit and zplugin are different names of the same thing**

An empty repository to aid zplugin's hooks-hacks. You can fork it to have a private copy of it :)

Example uses:

When what's needed is an atclone'' hook to e.g. install a software (plus atpull'' hook to update it):
```
# The invocation uses https://github.com/zdharma/null repo as a placeholder
# for the atclone'' and atpull'' hooks

zplugin ice as"program" pick"$ZPFX/sdkman/bin/sdk" id-as'sdkman' run-atpull \
  atclone"wget https://get.sdkman.io -O scr.sh; SDKMAN_DIR=$ZPFX/sdkman bash scr.sh" \
  atpull"SDKMAN_DIR=$ZPFX/sdkman sdk selfupdate" \
  atinit"export SDKMAN_DIR=$ZPFX/sdkman; source $ZPFX/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
zplugin light zdharma/null
```
